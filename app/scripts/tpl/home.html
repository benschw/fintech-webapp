			<h2 id="test">Welcome to Funder.</h2>
			<p>FUNDER is a site we built for FinTech Hackathon that demonstrates a way for local non-profits to gamify their online fund raising efforts.</p>
			<p>Splitting profit between the non-profit and the donors is a way to create excitement and a viral aspect that isn't usually present in a typical online donations drive.</p><br/>

			<h2 id="test">How does it work?</h2>
			<p>Non-profit organizations can post items for their followers to buy... with a twist. As soon as an item is purchased, it goes back up for purchase at an increased price. If another follower purchases the now-higher-priced item, the first follower is paid back, and splits the profit with the NPO.</p>
			<p>When the market closes (say, after a week) the items are shipped to the last purchasers.</p>
